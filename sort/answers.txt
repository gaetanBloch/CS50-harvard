sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Inconsistent time depending on the list => O(n^2) Î©(n)

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: almost constant time for all lists and faster than sort3 (selection sort) => O(n * log(n))

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: almost constant time for all lists but slower than sort2 (merge sort) => O(n^2)
