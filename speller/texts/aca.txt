        requirements of this paragraph if such pool--
                    (A) provides to all eligible individuals health 
                insurance coverage that does not impose any preexisting 
                condition exclusion with respect to such coverage;

                          (i) in which the issuer's share of the total 
                      allowed costs of benefits provided under such 
                      coverage is not less than 65 percent of such

                      1986 for the year involved, except that the 
                      Secretary may modify such limit if necessary to

                rate shall--
                          (i) except as provided in clause (ii), vary 
                      only as provided for under section 2701 of the 
                      Public Health Service Act (as amended by this Act 
                      and notwithstanding the date on which such 
                      amendments take effect);

        lawfully present in the United States (as determined in 
        accordance with section 1411);
            (2) has not been covered under creditable coverage (as 
        defined in section 2701(c)(1) of the Public Health Service Act 
        as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) during the 6-
        month period prior to the date on which such individual is 
        applying for coverage through the high risk pool; and
            (3) has a pre-existing condition, as determined in a manner 
        consistent with guidance issued by the Secretary.

    (e) Protection Against Dumping Risk by Insurers.--
            (1) In general.--The <<NOTE: Criteria.>> Secretary shall 
        establish criteria for determining whether health insurance 
        issuers and employment-based health plans have discouraged an 
        individual from remaining enrolled in prior coverage based on 
        that individual's health status.
            (2) Sanctions.--An issuer or employment-based health plan 
        shall be responsible for reimbursing the program under this 
        section for the medical expenses incurred by the program for an 
        individual who, based on criteria established by the Secretary, 
        the Secretary finds was encouraged by the issuer to disenroll 
        from health benefits coverage prior to enrolling in coverage 
        through the program. The criteria shall include at least the 
        following circumstances:
                    (A) In the case of prior coverage obtained through 
                an employer, the provision by the employer, group health 
                plan, or the issuer of money or other financial 
                consideration for disenrolling from the coverage.
                    (B) In the case of prior coverage obtained directly 
                from an issuer or under an employment-based health 
                plan--
                          (i) the provision by the issuer or plan of 
                      money or other financial consideration for 
                      disenrolling from the coverage; or
                          (ii) in the case of an individual whose 
                      premium for the prior coverage exceeded the 
                      premium required by the program (adjusted based on 
                      the age factors applied to the prior coverage)--
                                    (I) the prior coverage is a policy 
                                that is no longer being actively 
                                marketed (as defined by the Secretary) 
                                by the issuer; or
                                    (II) the prior coverage is a policy 
                                for which duration of coverage form 
                                issue or health status are factors that 
                                can be considered in determining 
                                premiums at renewal.
            (3) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        construed as constituting exclusive remedies for violations of 
        criteria established under paragraph (1) or as preventing States

[[Page 124 STAT. 143]]

        from applying or enforcing such paragraph or other provisions 
        under law with respect to health insurance issuers.

    (f) Oversight.--The Secretary shall establish--
            (1) an appeals process to enable individuals to appeal a 
        determination under this section; and
            (2) procedures to protect against waste, fraud, and abuse.

    (g) Funding; Termination of Authority.--
            (1) In general.--There is appropriated to the Secretary, out 
        of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, 
        $5,000,000,000 to pay claims against (and the administrative 
        costs of) the high risk pool under this section that are in 
        excess of the amount of premiums collected from eligible 
        individuals enrolled in the high risk pool. Such funds shall be 
        available without fiscal year limitation.
            (2) Insufficient funds.--If the Secretary estimates for any 
        fiscal year that the aggregate amounts available for the payment 
        of the expenses of the high risk pool will be less than the 
        actual amount of such expenses, the Secretary shall make such 
        adjustments as are necessary to eliminate such deficit.
            (3) Termination of authority.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), coverage of eligible individuals under a high risk 
                pool in a State shall terminate on January 1, 2014.
                    (B) Transition <<NOTE: Procedures.>> to exchange.--
                The Secretary shall develop procedures to provide for 
                the transition of eligible individuals enrolled in 
                health insurance coverage offered through a high risk 
                pool established under this section into qualified 
                health plans offered through an Exchange. Such 
                procedures shall ensure that there is no lapse in 
                coverage with respect to the individual and may extend 
                coverage after the termination of the risk pool 
                involved, if the Secretary determines necessary to avoid 
                such a lapse.
            (4) Limitations.--The Secretary has the authority to stop 
        taking applications for participation in the program under this 
        section to comply with the funding limitation provided for in 
        paragraph (1).
            (5) Relation to state laws.--The standards established under 
        this section shall supersede any State law or regulation (other 
        than State licensing laws or State laws relating to plan 
        solvency) with respect to qualified high risk pools which are 
        established in accordance with this section.

            (1) Employment-based plan eligibility.--A participating 
        employment-based plan is an employment-based plan that--
                    (A) meets the requirements of paragraph (2) with 
                respect to health benefits provided under the plan; and
                    (B) submits to the Secretary an application for 
                participation in the program, at such time, in such 
                manner, and containing such information as the Secretary 
                shall require.
            (2) Employment-based health benefits.--An employment-based 
        plan meets the requirements of this paragraph if the plan--
                    (A) implements programs and procedures to generate 
                cost-savings with respect to participants with chronic 
                and high-cost conditions;
                    (B) provides documentation of the actual cost of

                plan shall submit claims for reimbursement to the 
                Secretary which shall contain documentation of the 
                actual costs of the items and services for which each 
                claim is being submitted.
                    (B) Basis for claims.--Claims submitted under 
                subparagraph (A) shall be based on the actual amount 
                expended by the participating employment-based plan 
                involved within the plan year for the health benefits 
                provided to an early retiree or the spouse, surviving 
                spouse, or dependent of such retiree. In determining the 
                amount of a claim for purposes of this subsection, the 
                participating

[[Page 124 STAT. 145]]

                employment-based plan shall take into account any 
                negotiated price concessions (such as discounts, direct 
                or indirect subsidies, rebates, and direct or indirect 
                remunerations) obtained by such plan with respect to 
                such health benefit. For purposes of determining the 
                amount of any such claim, the costs paid by the early 
                retiree or the retiree's spouse, surviving spouse, or 
                dependent in the form of deductibles, co-payments, or 
                co-insurance shall be included in the amounts paid by 
                the participating employment-based plan.
            (2) Program payments.--If the Secretary determines that a 
        participating employment-based plan has submitted a valid claim 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall reimburse such plan for 
        80 percent of that portion of the costs attributable to such 
        claim that exceed $15,000, subject to the limits contained in 
        paragraph (3).
            (3) Limit.--To be eligible for reimbursement under the 
        program, a claim submitted by a participating employment-based 
        plan shall not be less than $15,000 nor greater than $90,000. 
        Such amounts shall be adjusted each fiscal year based on the 
        percentage increase in the Medical Care Component of the 
        Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (rounded to the 
        nearest multiple of $1,000) for the year involved.
            (4) Use of payments.--Amounts paid to a participating 
        employment-based plan under this subsection shall be used to 
        lower costs for the plan. Such payments may be used to reduce 
        premium costs for an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) 
        or to reduce premium contributions, co-payments, deductibles, 
        co-insurance, or other out-of-pocket costs for plan 
        participants. Such payments shall not be used as general 
        revenues for an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i). The 
        Secretary shall develop a mechanism to monitor the appropriate 
        use of such payments by such entities.
            (5) Payments not treated as income.--Payments received under 
        this subsection shall not be included in determining the gross 
        income of an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) that is 
        maintaining or currently contributing to a participating 
        employment-based plan.
            (6) Appeals.--The Secretary shall establish--
                    (A) an appeals process to permit participating 
                employment-based plans to appeal a determination of the 
                Secretary with respect to claims submitted under this 
                section; and
                    (B) procedures to protect against fraud, waste, and 
                abuse under the program.

    (d) Audits.--The Secretary shall conduct annual audits of claims 
data submitted by participating employment-based plans under this 
section to ensure that such plans are in compliance with the 
requirements of this section.

moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000,000 to 
carry out the program under this section. Such funds shall be available

                against their wishes on the basis of the individuals' 
                age or expected length of life or of the individuals'

                      relationship with the plan

[[Page 124 STAT. 165]]

                      for the providing of services that is more

                      that apply to emergency department services 
                      received from providers who do have such a 
                      contractual relationship with the plan; and
                          (ii) if such services are provided out-of-
                      network, the cost-sharing requirement (expressed 
                      as a copayment amount or coinsurance rate) is the 
                      same requirement that would apply if such services 
                      were provided in-network;
                    (F) provide that if a plan described in section 
                1311(b)(2)(B)(ii) (relating to stand-alone dental 
                benefits plans) is offered through an Exchange, another 
                health plan offered through such Exchange shall not fail 
                to be treated as a qualified health plan solely because 
                the plan does not offer coverage of benefits offered 
                through the stand-alone plan that are otherwise required 
                under paragraph (1)(J); and
                    (G) periodically review the essential health 
                benefits under paragraph (1), and provide a report to 
                Congress and the public that contains--
                          (i) an assessment of whether enrollees are 
                      facing any difficulty accessing needed services 
                      for reasons of coverage or cost;
                          (ii) an assessment of whether the essential 
                      health benefits needs to be modified or updated to 
                      account for changes in medical evidence or 
                      scientific advancement;
                          (iii) information on how the essential health 
                      benefits will be modified to address any such gaps 
                      in access or changes in the evidence base;
                          (iv) an assessment of the potential of 
                      additional or expanded benefits to increase costs 
                      and the interactions between the addition or 
                      expansion of benefits and reductions in existing 
                      benefits to meet actuarial limitations described 
                      in paragraph (2); and
                    (H) periodically update the essential health 
                benefits under paragraph (1) to address any gaps in 
                access to coverage or changes in the evidence base the 
                Secretary identifies in the review conducted under 
                subparagraph (G).
            (5) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this title shall be 
        construed to prohibit a health plan from providing benefits in 
        excess of the essential health benefits described in this 
        subsection.

    (c) Requirements Relating to Cost-Sharing.--
            (1) Annual limitation on cost-sharing.--
                    (A) 2014.--The cost-sharing incurred under a health

[[Page 124 STAT. 166]]

                          (i) in the case of self-only coverage, be 
                      equal to the dollar amount under subparagraph (A) 
                      for self-only coverage for plan years beginning in 
                      2014, increased by an amount equal to the product 
                      of that amount and the premium adjustment 
                      percentage under paragraph (4) for the calendar 
                      year; and
                          (ii) in the case of other coverage, twice the 
                      amount in effect under clause (i).
                If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a 
                multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the 
                next lowest multiple of $50.
            (2) Annual limitation on deductibles for employer-sponsored 
        plans.--
                    (A) In general.--In the case of a health plan 
                offered in the small group market, the deductible under 
                the plan shall not exceed--
                          (i) $2,000 in the case of a plan covering a 
                      single individual; and
                          (ii) $4,000 in the case of any other plan.
                The amounts under clauses (i) and (ii) may be increased 
                by the maximum amount of reimbursement which is 
                reasonably available to a participant under a flexible 
                spending arrangement described in section 106(c)(2) of 
                the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (determined without 
                regard to any salary reduction arrangement).
                    (B) Indexing of limits.--In the case of any plan 
                year beginning in a calendar year after 2014--
                          (i) the dollar amount under subparagraph 
                      (A)(i) shall be increased by an amount equal to 
                      the product of that amount and the premium 
                      adjustment percentage under paragraph (4) for the 
                      calendar year; and
                          (ii) the dollar amount under subparagraph 
                      (A)(ii) shall be increased to an amount equal to 
                      twice the amount in effect under subparagraph 
                      (A)(i) for plan years beginning in the calendar 
                      year, determined after application of clause (i).
                If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a 
                multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the 
                next lowest multiple of $50.
                    (C) Actuarial value.--The limitation under this 
                paragraph shall be applied in such a manner so as to not 
                affect the actuarial value of any health plan, including 
                a plan in the bronze level.
                    (D) Coordination with preventive limits.--Nothing in 
                this paragraph shall be construed to allow a plan to 
                have a deductible under the plan apply to benefits 
                described in section 2713 of the Public Health Service 
                Act.
            (3) Cost-sharing.--In this title--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``cost-sharing'' 
                includes--
                          (i) deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or 
                      similar charges; and
                          (ii) any other expenditure required of an 
                      insured individual which is a qualified medical 
                      expense (within the meaning of section 223(d)(2) 
                      of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) with respect 
                      to essential health benefits covered under the

                    (B) Exceptions.--Such term does not include 
                premiums, balance billing amounts for non-network 
                providers, or spending for non-covered services.
            (4) Premium <<NOTE: Determination. Deadline.>> adjustment 
        percentage.--For purposes of paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and (2)(B)(i), 
        the premium adjustment percentage for any calendar year is the 
        percentage (if any) by which the average per capita premium for 
        health insurance coverage in the United States for the preceding 
        calendar year (as estimated by the Secretary no later than 
        October 1 of such preceding calendar year) exceeds such average 
        per capita premium for 2013 (as determined by the Secretary).

    (d) Levels of Coverage.--
            (1) Levels of coverage defined.--The levels of coverage 
        described in this subsection are as follows:
                    (A) Bronze level.--A plan in the bronze level shall 
                provide a level of coverage that is designed to provide 
                benefits that are actuarially equivalent to 60 percent 
                of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided 
                under the plan.
                    (B) Silver level.--A plan in the silver level shall 
                provide a level of coverage that is designed to provide

                of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided 
                under the plan.
                    (C) Gold level.--A plan in the gold level shall 
                provide a level of coverage that is designed to provide 
                benefits that are actuarially equivalent to 80 percent 
                of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided

            (2) Actuarial value.--
                    (A) In general.--Under regulations issued by the 
                Secretary, the level of coverage of a plan shall be 
                determined on the basis that the essential health 
                benefits described in subsection (b) shall be provided 
                to a standard population (and without regard to the 
                population the plan may actually provide benefits to).
                    (B) Employer contributions.--The Secretary may issue 
                regulations under which employer contributions to a 
                health savings account (within the meaning of section 
                223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) may be taken 
                into account in determining the level of coverage for a 
                plan of the employer.
                    (C) Application.--In determining under this title, 
                the Public Health Service Act, or the Internal Revenue 
                Code of 1986 the percentage of the total allowed costs 
                of benefits provided under a group health plan or health 
                insurance coverage that are provided by such plan or 
                coverage, the rules contained in the regulations under 
                this paragraph shall apply.
            (3) Allowable variance.-- <<NOTE: Guidelines.>> The 
        Secretary shall develop guidelines to provide for a de minimis 
        variation in the actuarial valuations used in determining the 
        level of coverage of a plan to account for differences in 
        actuarial estimates.

[[Page 124 STAT. 168]]

            (4) Plan reference.--In this title, any reference to a 
        bronze, silver, gold, or platinum plan shall be treated as a 
        reference to a qualified health plan providing a bronze, silver, 
        gold, or platinum level of coverage, as the case may be.

                      essential health benefits determined under 
                      subsection (b), except that the plan provides no 
                      benefits for any plan year until the individual 
                      has incurred cost-sharing expenses in an amount 
                      equal to the annual limitation in effect under 
                      subsection (c)(1) for the plan year (except as 
                      provided for in section 2713); and
                          (ii) coverage for at least three primary care 
                      visits.
            (2) Individuals eligible for enrollment.--An individual is

                beginning of the plan year; or
                    (B) has a certification in effect for any plan year 
                under this title that the individual is exempt from the 
                requirement under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue 
                Code of 1986 by reason of--

                      option. Services described in subparagraph (B)(ii)

                      services are covered under title XIX of the Social 
                      Security Act.
                    (D) Assured availability of varied coverage through

                                that provides coverage of services

                segregate an amount equal to the actuarial amounts

                          (ii) Considerations.--In making such estimate,

                                on overall costs of the inclusion of 
                                such coverage, but may not take into 
                                account any cost reduction estimated

[[Page 124 STAT. 171]]

                                to result from such services, including 
                                prenatal care, delivery, or postnatal

                                    (II) shall estimate such costs as if

        <<NOTE: Abortions.>> No individual health care provider or

        willingness or an unwillingness, if doing so is contrary to the 
        religious or moral beliefs of the provider or facility, to 
        provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.

    (b) Application of State and Federal Laws Regarding Abortion.--

                    (A) meet marketing requirements, and not employ 
                marketing practices or benefit designs that have the 
                effect of discouraging the enrollment in such plan by 
                individuals with significant health needs;
                    (B) ensure a sufficient choice of providers (in a

                provisions under section 2702(c) of the Public Health 
                Service Act), and provide information to enrollees and

                that serve predominately low-income, medically-

                defined in section 340B(a)(4) of the Public Health 
                Service Act and providers described in section

                forth by section 221 of Public Law 111-8, except that 
                nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to 
                require any health plan to provide coverage for any 
                specific medical procedure;
                    (D)(i) be accredited with respect to local 
                performance on clinical quality measures such as the

                patient experience ratings on a standardized Consumer 
                Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, 
                as well as consumer access, utilization management, 
                quality assurance, provider credentialing, complaints 
                and appeals, network adequacy and access, and patient 
                information programs by any entity recognized by the 
                Secretary for the accreditation of health insurance 
                issuers or plans (so long as any such entity has 
                transparent and rigorous methodological and scoring 
                criteria); or
                    (ii) receive such accreditation within a period 
                established by an Exchange for such accreditation that 
                is applicable to all qualified health plans;
                    (E) implement a quality improvement strategy 
                described in subsection (g)(1);
                    (F) utilize a uniform enrollment form that qualified 
                individuals and qualified employers may use (either 
                electronically or on paper) in enrolling in qualified 
                health plans offered through such Exchange, and that 
                takes into account criteria that the National 
                Association of Insurance Commissioners develops and 
                submits to the Secretary;
                    (G) utilize the standard format established for

                enrollees, and to each Exchange in which the plan is 
                offered, on any quality measures for health plan 
                performance endorsed under section 399JJ of the Public 
                Health Service Act, as applicable.

[[Page 124 STAT. 175]]

            (2) Rule of construction.-- <<NOTE: Contracts.>> Nothing in 
        paragraph (1)(C) shall be construed to require a qualified

        paragraph if such provider refuses to accept the generally 
        applicable payment rates of such plan.
            (3) Rating system.--The Secretary shall develop a rating 
        system that would rate qualified health plans offered through an 
        Exchange in each benefits level on the basis of the relative 
        quality and price. The Exchange shall include the quality rating 
        in the information provided to individuals and employers through 
        the Internet portal established under paragraph (4).
            (4) Enrollee satisfaction system.--The Secretary shall 
        develop an enrollee satisfaction survey system that would

                exclude a health plan--

                eligible for 1 or more qualified health plans offered in 
                the small group market through an Exchange that offers

                      market in the State to offer qualified health 
                      plans in such market through an Exchange. Nothing 
                      in this subparagraph shall be construed as 
                      requiring the issuer to offer such plans through 
                      an Exchange.
                          (ii) Large employers eligible.--If a State 
                      under clause (i) allows issuers to offer qualified 
                      health plans in the large group market through an

                      include a large employer that elects to make all 
                      full-time employees of such employer eligible for

        the individual shall not be treated as a qualified individual 
        and may not be covered under a qualified health plan in the 
        individual market that is offered through an Exchange.

                less than 3 times and not more than 6 times the amount 
                of damages which the Government sustains because of the 
                act of that person.

        insurance coverage outside of Exchanges), the expenses of 
        Exchanges, claims statistics relating to qualified health plans, 
        complaints data relating to such plans, and the manner in which

        shall, as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, issue regulations setting standards for meeting the 
        requirements under this title, and the amendments made by this

                adjustment programs under part V; and
                    (D) such other requirements as the Secretary 
                determines appropriate.
        The preceding sentence shall not apply to standards for 
        requirements under subtitles A and C (and the amendments made by

        the Public Health Service Act.
            (2) Consultation.--In issuing the regulations under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the National

        or
            (2) a State law or regulation that the Secretary determines 
        implements the standards within the State.

    (c) Failure To Establish Exchange or Implement Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--If--
                    (A) a State is not an electing State under 
                subsection (b); or
                    (B) <<NOTE: Determination. Deadline.>> the Secretary 
                determines, on or before January 1, 2013, that an 
                electing State--
                          (i) will not have any required Exchange 
                      operational by January 1, 2014; or
                          (ii) has not taken the actions the Secretary 
                      determines necessary to implement--
                                    (I) the other requirements set forth 
                                in the standards under subsection (a);

                                made by such subtitles;
        the Secretary shall (directly or through agreement with a not-
        for-profit entity) establish and operate such Exchange within 
        the State and the Secretary shall take such actions as are 
        necessary to implement such other requirements.

            (2) Enforcement authority.-- <<NOTE: Applicability.>> The 
        provisions of section 2736(b) of the Public Health Services Act

        limitation on the application of those provisions to group 
        health plans).

    (d) No Interference With State Regulatory Authority.--Nothing in 
this title shall be construed to preempt any State law that does not

        has insured a percentage of its population not less than the 
        percentage of the population projected to be covered nationally 
        after the implementation of this Act, that seeks to operate an 
        Exchange under this section, the Secretary shall presume that 
        such Exchange meets the standards under this section unless the 
        Secretary determines, after completion of the process 
        established under paragraph (2), that the Exchange does not 
        comply with such standards.
            (2) Process.--The Secretary shall establish a process to 
        work with a State described in paragraph (1) to provide 
        assistance necessary to assist the State's Exchange in coming 
        into compliance with the standards for approval under this 
        section.

                meeting its start-up costs; and
                    (B) grants to provide assistance to such person in 
                meeting any solvency requirements of States in which the 
                person seeks to be licensed to issue qualified health 
                plans.

                          (ii) give priority to applicants that will 
                      offer qualified health plans on a Statewide basis,

                      the establishment of multiple qualified nonprofit 
                      health insurance issuers in any State if the 
                      funding is sufficient to do so.
                    (B) States without issuers in program.--If no health 
                insurance issuer applies to be a qualified nonprofit 
                health insurance issuer within a State, the Secretary 
                may use amounts appropriated under this section for the 
                awarding of grants to encourage the establishment of a 
                qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer within the 
                State or the expansion of a qualified nonprofit health
